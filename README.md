Chant21: Plainchant in Python
=============================

Chant21 adds further support for plainchant to music21. It includes converters 
for [GABC](http://gregorio-project.github.io/gabc/index.html) and Volpiano as 
used by the Cantus Database. Both are converted to a rich chant representation 
retaining the exact structure of the chant: its division in sections, words,
syllables and neumes. Chant21 also adds very fast chant typesetting
in Jupyter notebooks, where the chant structure can also be explored 
interactively. Chant21 is released with two large plainchant Corpora: 
the [GregoBaseCorpus](todo) and the [CantusCorpus](todo).
