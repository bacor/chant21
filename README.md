`chant21` — Plainchant in Python
=============================

`chant21` improves the support for plainchant in 
[`music21`](http://web.mit.edu/music21/).

- Converters for [GABC](http://gregorio-project.github.io/gabc/index.html) 
and Volpiano as used by the [Cantus Database](cantus.uwaterloo.ca/). 
- Represention of the chants complete structure in `music21`: its division 
in sections, words, syllables and neumes. 
- Very fast and interactive chant visualization in Jupyter notebooks.
- Usable with two large plainchant Corpora: 
the [GregoBaseCorpus](https://github.com/bacor/gregobasecorpus)
and the [CantusCorpus](https://github.com/bacor/cantuscorpus).
